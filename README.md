# Note

This repository is no longer actively maintained.

The contents of this repository is not an endorsement of the Trium printer. I keep it alive on request of some Trium owners.  

I stopped working on the Trium and I am considering buying another printer.

My own experiences with the Trium is rather negative. 
- If you want to buy a good delta frame to serve as a basis for your own delta printer, it is probably a reasonable design (although I am convinced you can get a less expensive delta frame).
- If you want to learn how to refurbish and rebuild delta printers, this is also a fair kit to buy.
- If you want a printer to print parts and not spend countless hours to get the printer going, rather go buy a well tested design with a large user base. The [Josef Prusa Original i3 MK2](http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/) (not some cheap rip-off) does not cost significantly more than the Trium is has a good reputation (but do your own research).


# Purpose

This repo serves to capture the experience of a number of Trium 3D printer builders.

This repo document is not official Trium information and does not endorse the product in any way. You will find that most Trium users are loyal to the product, but do your own research before committing to a purchase.

The reference information for Trium construction is the [E-Mergin Innovation](https://emergin.net/) Trium printer's  [User Manual (Ver 0.15)](https://emergin.net//user-manual/)  and the assortment of  [videos  on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81HdwWcrpt0&list=PLMmAHPJoXlL8cp_-7R_6Hdb887jVPCUp3).

This repo contains information that is supplementary to the E-Mergin reference documentation and serves to capture some of the information
-  found on the [Trium ProBoard web site](http://trium3d.proboards.com),
-  found on the [Trium Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/emergin/) (For my own part, I find the Facebook interface confusing and I don't spend much time there), 
-  learned by a few builders when contructing their Trium printers, and 
-  found on the internet,
