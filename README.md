# Purpose

This repo serves to capture the experience of a number of Trium 3D printer builders.

The reference information for Trium construction is the [E-Mergin Innovation](https://emergin.net/) Trium printer's  [User Manual (Ver 0.15)](https://emergin.net//user-manual/)  and the assortment of  [videos  on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81HdwWcrpt0&list=PLMmAHPJoXlL8cp_-7R_6Hdb887jVPCUp3).

This document is supplementary to the E-Mergin reference documentation and serves to capture some of the information
-  of general interest on the internet,
-  found on the [Trium ProBoard web site](http://trium3d.proboards.com),
-  found on the [Trium Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/emergin/), and
-  learned by a few builders when contructing their Trium printers.

For my own part, I find the Facebook interface confusing and I don't spend much time there.
